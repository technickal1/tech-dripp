How Can Google Home Support Me In Everyday Life? With these features, Google Home helps you, your family, in everyday life:

### Get Answers From Google Assistant

You can ask Google questions with Google Home. The Google Assistant uses various Google services such as web search, maps, YouTube, and many others to answer. Get up-to-date information in real time, such as weather, traffic, financial topics, and sports scores. Google can [remember things](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-home-remember-where-i-put-things/). Try saying something like,

> "Hey Google, remember that I put my batteries in the junk draw" 

> "Remember that my password is password"

You can recall remembered things with:

> "Hey Google, where are my batteries?" 

> "What is my password?"

### Listen To Music With All of Your Favorite Service(s)

Whenever you feel like listening to music or dancing around in the living room, Google Home makes it possible. With a simple voice command, you can play your songs, playlists, artists, albums, and radio from Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn, and Google Play Music. 

The multi-room feature allows you to group Google Home(s), Chromecast Audio(s), and more so that you can hear the same song in each room. 

Another cool trick to do with Google is to listen to your local radio stations. Just say:

> "Hey Google, listen to 98.7"

_Note: When asking to play a specific song, you'll need a paid subscription to Spotify or YouTube Red._

### Organize Everyday Life in the \[Smart] Home

There is always a lot to do at home. With your permission, Google Home can help you and your family, including informing you about your appointments, travel planning, and the fastest way to work. 

In addition, Google Home sets alarms, can start timers, and put things on your shopping list.

#### Control your Smart Home

Google Home seamlessly connects to your compatible smart devices and turns on, for example, the light in the living room. It supports popular smart home systems such as Philips Hue, WeMo, LIFX, and TP-Link. 

You can also use Google Home and Chromecast to stream video content from Netflix (Netflix subscription required) and YouTube to your TV by voice. Use this command for playing to Netflix:

> "Hey Google, play The Flash on the \[Family Room] TV." *Brackets are the name of your Chromecast.

### What Things Can I Ask Google Home?
