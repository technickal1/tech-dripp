  Amazon Echo, or Alexa, for friends ... it's not that simple to explain what
  it's about. Think of [Siri](https://www.cnet.com/tags/siri/) (the virtual
  assistant of the iPhone) and imagine that it takes a physical dimension and
  chooses a cylinder that is a bluetooth speaker.

## **The Fancier Bluetooth Speaker, Controlled by Voice**

Amazon Echo seemingly works like a bluetooth speaker, but in reality it is much more than that. First, it is controlled completely by voice. Therefore, you just have to tell Alexa what you want. If you are in reggae mood, just say:

> "Alexa, play Bob Marley."

Alexa will take a look at [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-One-Year-Membership/dp/B00DBYBNEE) to find songs by Bob Marley. Alexa can also buy things for you. 

Need paper towels? Batteries? There's also a re-ordering process that allows you to easily order items you have in the past. 

You can also buy nearly anything else on Amazon.com.

> "Alexa...
>
> buy a backpack."
>
> buy paper towels."
>
> buy batteries." 
>
> buy an inflatable hot tub."

...and you'll have a backpack on your doorstep. Or, paper towels, batteries, or even [an inflatable hot tub](http://a.co/d/d5yoTlx) will be delivered to you. 

This is the \[Amazon] brand's way of entering home automation, while eliminating shopping options on other websites.

## **Home Automation by Alexa With the Echo**

Another key aspect is that you can make your voice control your home. Alexa can connect to most [home automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) devices. For example, it works quite well with another great invention, [Philips Hue](http://amzn.to/2jhO1B3) bulbs. 

Regarding the Echo, Amazon has had a mixed result with its hardware experiences. When Amazon entered the mobile phone market with the Amazon Fire Phone, it was a catastrophe -- it was not solely the design's fault, its high price and the lack of Google Play services makes the phone a lousy gadget. 

Apparently, with Alexa, Amazon is back on the right track. At the hardware level, the \[newer] Echo comes in aÂ 5.9" x 3.5" x 3.5" sized cylinder weighing in at 29 ounces. 

It includes seven microphone sensors, a speaker, light ring, and 2.5" woofer. ![echo technical specs](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/dp/2017/573804867210/ts-image3._CB515464582_.jpg) **What to use the Echo for day to day:**

* Listen to music from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).
* General information instead of searching with Google on a phone, tablet, or laptop.
  _Disclaimer: Alexa uses Bing, not Google for a search engine._
* Find out if it's going to rain.
* Turn [smart lights](http://amzn.to/2i068Z3) on and off in different areas of the house.
* Put products that you need in your shopping cart.

At the time of this writing, as a music player it is not the best. One functionality that came to change the rules of the game recently, was that Spotify can be your default player for music. 

This is an advantage because the musical variety is much greater than Amazon's Prime Music service.

## Amazon Echo App and No Portable Battery

Echo is [accompanied by an app](http://amzn.to/2Ay8jdZ) that serves for your configuration. It is not necessary to use it so much in the day to day but it allows to improve the usability enough. 

There are still some details that still need to be adjusted. For example, when you try to call Alexa while the music is playing: it hardly reacts; that's when you use the remote control (optional). 

This can be a benefit, but it is also a sign that the voice command is not 100% optimized. I am sorry that so much technology has to live connected to the plug. You should have a rechargeable battery. Here is a bad point where Amazon will have to work. 

It is also a pity that it is not yet programmed in other languages â€‹â€‹and that Alexa only understands English. But it is normal since the product is only available in the United States at the moment. 

Amazon recently opened the application to make the Echo compatible with other developers. Thanks to that, Alexa is present in other devices, offering a world of possibilities. Every week, you can opt to have Amazon send an email with the new functions of Alexa. 

With the growth of the use and all the artificial intelligence that supports it, Alexa will be able to know us more and more and anticipate our needs. Afraid... maybe, but practical, too.

## Overall Thoughts About The Echo Device

It is worth buying. Although the truth might be it's not perfect, it continues to evolve day-by-day. And the price is a bit higher than many Bluetooth speakers that flood the market, but clearly, this is much more than a simple speaker. 

Upcoming: the new [Amazon Echo Show](http://amzn.to/2hpqf5G) incorporates a touch screen and camera for video calls for the first time. Really looking forward to how this plays in the market!Â You'll also be able to use Amazon's cloud services such as Amazon Photos, Drive, or Amazon Music to search your favorite content.
