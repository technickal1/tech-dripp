  Sometimes I just want to know what my computer has in it. Here's a quick way
  to do that.

On Windows 10, go to the Start search box, type **msinfo32.**

_FYI: you can also do **Win + Q **instead of using a mouse**.**_

You're looking for **System Information**

![system-information-windows-10](https://ucarecdn.com/7be7c969-e409-455d-ba13-8cd6eaed6a55/)

That's it.
