For anyone that uses smart home devices, you might know how expensive it can become (once the addiction begins) to start adding to your smart home setup. 

Find the WyzeCam on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2hidirj) | [Wyze Labs](https://www.wyzecam.com/product/wyze-cam/#home) 

Thankfully, the [WyzeCam](http://wyzecam.com) comes to deliver for those hoping to pay less for technology, but still getting the features they want.

> Fun Fact: The Wyze Labs, Inc. founding members actually came from Amazon. They were looking to form a customer-centric smart home technology company. 

_Their passion: "providing customers access to high-quality products at great prices."_

## Big Features That Matter - 1080 Full HD, Night Vision, 2-Way Audio

##### 1080p Full HD

This is really something you come to expect with a camera in 2017, but believe it or not, there are still cameras on the market that only dish out 720p. Pretty crazy, but true. So, for the value, 1080p is a heck of a deal!

##### Live Stream With WyzeCam App

We're hoping this thing gets support for SmartThings and you're able to connect it with other home automation setups. It would be great to fill the home with four cameras less than $100! There's an 8x digital zoom with the Wyze App's live stream.

##### Night Vision

With a F2.0 aperture, that's going to give some impressive night-time camera shots. Right now, the camera boasts a 30 foot range for clarity - even in total darkness. Not an easy feat.

##### Flexible Design (that's different from the rest)

One of the features that sets this apart is a completely different design approach that the camera uses. It has a 3-axis assembly that allows it to point in any direction. Included with the camera is a metal plate and tape (used with a magnetic base) to mount it where you'd like -- without screws.

##### Motion Detection and Alert Videos

Motion video alerts are included with the Wyze App, so you'll be able to see when a package is delivered (with a glass door) or if something is going on around your house.

##### Smart Sound Recognition (smoke alarms / carbon monoxide)

This is another area where the camera excels. For existing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide (CO) monitors, WyzeCam can send an alert to your phone to make sure you can stay away from whatever might be going on in the home and get to safety. Smart Sound Recognition is part of an 'advanced algorithm' that listens to unique sound patterns in the air.

##### 14-Day Free Cloud Storage

Right now, cloud storage for cameras is a big deal. On one hand, consumers want to have the option to access their data/video from the cloud whenever they'd like. But, on the other hand, subscription models are taking over peoples' lives. 

WyzeCam offers 14-day, rolling cloud storage. There's a nominal fee -- _nothing_. Yes, that's correct, secured videos go to the cloud for free. When motion or sound is detected, a 10-15 second alert video is recorded. Absolutely no subscription is required for the service.

> For those that are curious: videos are uploaded to the AWS Cloud via end-to-end encryption and are accessible for 14 days.

For reference, the [Arlo camera gives 7 days of cloud recordings](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/products/subscription-plans.aspx) for free.

##### Continuous Recording

If you're inclined to use local storage, pop in a microSD card for continuous recording and storage. Once the microSD card is full, the oldest files will be overwritten.

##### 2-Way Audio

In the camera is a built-in speaker and microphone. You can both listen and respond by talking with those around. This is a nice feature -- especially for those waiting around for the [Google Home broadcast feature](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16412256/google-home-update-voice-text-message-support).

##### Time Lapse

I find this to be a pretty nifty feature. Using pictures instead of videos can not only save a bunch of space, but you can get a cool effect from changes over time. 

When you want the WyzeCam to use the time lapse feature, simply schedule both a start and end time with how often you want pictures taken. The outcome will be a time lapse video.

It's scary and exciting to see a product like this come down the line. As a [family trying to run a smart home](https://techdripp.com/future-of-smart-homes-connected-life/), making it easier to gain access to cameras that will be monitoring my house is iffy. 

Hopefully with the IoT boom, we can be conscious about security and not so conscious about the bottom line.
