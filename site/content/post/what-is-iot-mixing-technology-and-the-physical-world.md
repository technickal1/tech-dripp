  Back in 1938, tech evolution started. This evolution was not biological, but
  technological. After the invention of the first functional computer in the
  world, technology started to grow rapidly.

The things which were all physical and manual in their appearance and functioning are now governed by the computer. Firstly, it was used only by few big association of the world which later transported it out to the world. Cell phones were considered to be the biggest achievement; as a common man had an access to technology.

But now the meaning of Technology and Smart are widened by connecting them to the physical and tangible household products. Technology which is described as the skill and tactics, ways and the processes used to achieve some certain objectives when combined with the internet. Smart home tech appliances are one example of it.

## The Internet of Things (IoT)

This term was [coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) in 1999.

Internet of Things is the entire network of physical devices. This includes day to day usage appliances like vehicles and other items implanted with electronics and software, sensors and network connectivity.

## What Is The Aim of IoT?

Internet of things aims to connect the entire physical layer. When the internet started, it created a “virtual” environment where you can make changes online.

Think about the devices at home -- your coffee maker, lamps, electronics, and appliances. Basically anything that can be plugged in will be controlled with IoT.

## What Does The “Thing” Mean In IoT?

A thing in easy words could be defined as any device that can be assigned an IP address. It can also transfer data over a network, thus allowing a connection to the internet.

## Applications Of IoT: Consumer Uses

A considerable portion of IoT devices are now being manufactured for consumer use. Since IoT aims to help the human race, there are many devices being introduced in the market that are centrally controlled.

## Examples of Using an Internet of Things thing

Example 1: Appliances like a washer and dryer can be set up for notifications. Think about receiving a text or push notification that your load of laundry is done. 

Better yet, how about having a [color-changing light bulb](http://amzn.to/2jCaO7j) turn to blue when the clothes need put into the dryer.

Example 2: Electronics like a TV, air purifier, fan, or coffee maker [can be turned on and off](http://amzn.to/2i5Kbat) (along with power consumption tracking) along with other smart devices. 

The cool thing is that since not all devices work over WiFi, they can be controlled via [Z-Wave](https://www.smarthome.com/sc-what-is-zwave-home-automation) or [Zigbee](https://www.the-ambient.com/guides/zigbee-devices-complete-guide-277).

## Home Automation with IoT

This term is another synonym of Smart Home. It requires a main controller -- in the new consumer model, it’s typically [a SmartThings Hub](http://amzn.to/2i6C8dw). This provides users with a central control for your smart devices.

## Using Smart Devices with Disabled and/or Elderly

One of the purposes of a smart home is to provide the disabled and elderly people with help and assistance. While they are home, they can speak to digital assistants like a Google Home or Amazon Alexa.

The users who have sight and mobility disabilities can turn on their devices using a voice command feature. They can control all of their devices without the need to touch or see them. 

Eventually, there will be home services helping with IoT device installation.

Many other features can be introduced, for example, those with sight limitation could be provided with a sensor that detects something like falls and seizures. When a notification is triggered, the caretaker, nurse, or any other family member could rush to them from the alarm.

## IoT of Medical And Healthcare Industry

IoT is now connected to the health monitoring devices as well to assist in the field of medicine and health care. These include blood pressure monitors, heart rate monitoring devices, electronic wristbands and advanced hearing aids.

Some hospitals are using smart beds as well. These beds have sensors that can detect whether they are occupied or the patient is trying to get up.

Internet of Things is not only limited to the field of healthcare. It could involve transportation, agriculture, environmental monitoring and many others as well.

## Agriculture and Transportation with IoT

Farmers could detect through their mobile apps which land is already cultivated, quality of soil, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, temperature and other such soil conditions. 

They could even determine whether a plant would be sustainable in a certain climate.

Transportation when provided with smart devices would become much easier. Features like smart or online toll collection and smart parking would make it much more fun.

It should be accepted that IoT is a revolution and not evolutionary category. It is instilled in the life of humans rather than becoming another technology craze.
