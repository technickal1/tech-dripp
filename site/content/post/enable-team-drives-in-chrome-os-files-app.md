  One of the features I'd really like to see in a Chromebook is the ability to
  see Team Drives in the files app. I've been using them on my phone from quite
  some time and it's really helpful to share things.

I recently came across a way to use team drives in my version of Chrome OS! This is an exciting addition to my Pixelbook.

#### Quick and Easy Directions

1. Head to **chrome://flags**
2. Look for **Enable Team Drives IntegrationÂ **option and     choose **Enabled (**default should be disabled)
3. Restart Chrome in order for the changes to take effect. 

*Remember that chrome flags are experimental!

\*Remember that the chrome://flags settings are experimental, so there might be a chance you see two. 

I saw two options with 'My Drive' and 'Team Drives' in my Files app. If this happens to you, I was able to disable and re-enable the option to fix it. Not like it takes a long time to restart anyway! 

Otherwise, now you should see the Google Drive drop-down with the **Team Drives** collapsible menu item. All of your favorite team drives will now be available the same as any Google Drive files you've worked with previously. ![chrome files app team drives](https://techdripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chrome-files-app-team-drives.png) Google is slowly starting to bridge the gap with Chromebooks and the way we work with our files. It's nice to see that there are easier ways to use team drives instead of having to go through [drive.google.com](http://drive.google.com). 

I'm always looking forward to more features with primarily the Pixelbook, but having the option available for other Chromebooks will be a big plus. 

Hopefully Team Drives will become a standard integration. If you're reading this in the future and they are, that's awesome! ![](https://techdripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Nick_Signature.png)
