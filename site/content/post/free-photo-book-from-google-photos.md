  Google has a huge push right now with making people aware of their services.
  Two of those services are being promoted with the fun little game -- Google Fi
  (cell service) and a Google Photo Book.

Right now if you're a Google Fi customer you can get a free photo book. A nice perk for those who haven't quite experienced the service enough to compare.

They're taking the initiative to promote Google photos and also how easy it is to create the tangible photos. Interesting how the intertwining of digital + physical is coming together.

Head over to [fiholiday.withgoogle.com](https://fiholiday.withgoogle.com/) and play the fun game. I've even included a GIF to show it! Sped up a bit, but fun nonetheless.
